# BreakInfinityFormatter
 A variable formatter for the BreakInfinity repository, its purpose is to format values generated with BigDouble in a way that the end user can understand and read. It is particularly useful in games, where instead of representing numbers as 1E+17, it shows them as 1aa, or instead of displaying 1E+6, it represents them as 1T
